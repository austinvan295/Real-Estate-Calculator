<h3> This project was designed to help real estate investors analyze rental/commmerical properties such as Single Family Homes, Multi-Family Homes, Commercial Building, Duplexes, and many more investment properties. It uses common formulas that investors use today such as Cash On Cash Return, Price-Rent Ratio, The One Percent Rule, Cap Rate, and etc. Not only does it help developers look for potential properties, but it also saves the homes to a txt file just in case investors want to keep track of the homes they are looking at. I created this calculator because I am looking to invest in real estate in the near future, but there are so many formulas to look at and it seemed discouraging at first. I decided just to create my own calculator not just for me, but for others to help analyze properties all in one page. In addition, I also implemented a mortgage calculator as well within the program to help determine your monthly payments if you decided to finance the property.
